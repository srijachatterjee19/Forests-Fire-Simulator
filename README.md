# Forests-Fire-Simulator ðŸ”¥

This project was built to model the spread of fire in a 2D forest environment as a part of the MOD003197 Object Oriented C++ module. Fire simulation can be modelled in software and is an important area of research in fire safety,fire drill management, fire investigation, and with applications in many computer
game scenarios.

The simulation composed of a 21x21 grid of cells, where all cells contain a tree except for a 1-cell thick perimeter boundary layer of empty cells. The boundary is similar to a firebreak or an area with no trees; proximity to such a boundary cell cannot cause an internal tree to catch fire. This insulating boundary is called an absorbing boundary condition. The forest was represented using ASCII characters & for a tree, an x for a burning tree and a blank space for an empty cell.
